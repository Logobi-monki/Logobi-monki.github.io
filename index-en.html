  <h4 class="sub-title">Methods to Become an Effective Learner</h4>

  <p>There are several methods that can promote the development of a learner’s skills:</p>

  <ol>
    <li>Keep unnecessary electronic devices away while studying.</li>
    <li>
      Use active recall techniques: These techniques help transfer information from short-term to long-term memory.
      <ul>
        <li>Read your notes at night, go to sleep, and review them aloud in the morning.</li>
        <li>
          <i>Flashcards</i>: Everyone knows about flashcards, but few people know how to use them effectively. Most people make the mistake of passively reading them. Instead, create them with essential information, write them yourself, make sure each card contains short and precise info, and review them at least once a day for two weeks before the exam.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Do not procrastinate and leave schoolwork until the last minute.</li>
  </ol>

  <h4 class="sub-title">What’s better: Studying alone or in a group?</h4>
  <div class="text-image">
    <p>Studying alone or in a group depends on your learning style. Group study is ideal for stimulating understanding, exchanging ideas, and teaching each other, but be careful! In 99% of cases where students studied in groups larger than five, they ended up socializing instead of studying. They talk about their weekends, their dogs, and easily lose focus. That’s why for intensive study sessions, it’s better to study alone. You can also study at the local library, which offers a calm and quiet environment.</p>

  <h4 class="sub-title">Coffee or Energy Drinks: Which One to Choose?</h4>
  <div class="text-image">
    <p>Coffee and energy drinks are often used by students to study late at night. Caffeine increases alertness, improves concentration, and reduces fatigue by blocking adenosine, making coffee and energy drinks common choices for late study sessions.</p>

    <p>Energy drinks provide a temporary boost due to their high sugar content, but after the initial effect, they can reduce concentration, increase stress, anxiety, and nervousness. They may cause energy crashes, palpitations, and disrupt sleep, which negatively affects focus.</p>

      <p id="toCenter">Drinking coffee while studying temporarily improves alertness, concentration, short-term memory, and mood. Moderate consumption (1-4 cups/day) is generally safe, but exceeding 400 mg/day can cause anxiety, insomnia, palpitations, and dependence.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="text-image">
    <p>Finally, a NIH study showed that coffee consumption increases the brain’s memory capacity. As shown in the diagram, people who consumed coffee performed better when recalling information on demand.</p>

  <h4 class="sub-title">Using Music</h4>
  <div class="text-image">
    <p>
      Many people listen to music while studying, but is it really helpful? Some say music is a distraction while others cannot study without it. Studies show lyrical or rhythmic music can interfere with learning, because your brain processes both the music lyrics and your notes at the same time, which can lead to singing rather than focusing. However, if you need music to concentrate, lyric-free music such as lo-fi can be a good choice. Rhythmic or lyrical music is better for tasks that require little attention, like checking emails or researching online for a project.

  <h5 class="sub-title">When Not to Listen to Music?</h5>
  <div class="text-image">
    <div class="center-container">
      <p id="toCenter">
        If a task requires full concentration, it is better not to listen to music and continue in silence, allowing your brain to remove distractions and focus entirely on the task.

  <h4 class="sub-title">How to Stay Organized?</h4>
  <div class="text-image">
    <p>
      To be an effective learner, you need to know how to stay organized. Use a planner to note homework, exams, due dates, etc. A well-organized planner increases efficiency, reduces wasted time, and lets you track your day accurately. You can schedule study periods by subject, giving more time to difficult subjects and less to easier ones. For example, on a week, you might study math for 30 minutes on Monday, then science for 15 minutes, and so on. If that’s difficult, focus on one subject at a time.
